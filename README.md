1. clone
2. npm i
3. npm run dev

What could I do better in your code next iteration?

1. I would pay more attention to specifications, for eg: for each change in filters this app should
   call api, and not just filter them locally.

2. Style it more

3. debounce inputs

4. spend more time in general, pay more attention to details

5. My time was limited, i only used 19 december to start and finish this in few hours.
